			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#202020]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#ffbd59]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#5e83d6]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#ffffff]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h3>Typography</h3>

Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>An example of the info needed for each shop:</p>
            <img src="pickmeup.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Location: 76 W 2nd S, Rexburg, ID 83440</p>
            <p>Website:<a href="https://www.pickmeupdrinks.com/">https://www.pickmeupdrinks.com/</a> </p>
            <p>Hours:M-T 7:30AM-10PM, F 7:30AM-10PM, Sa 9AM-10AM, Su Closed </p>
            <p>Description: Anyone can pour drinks into a cup and sure, our drinks and cookies are amazing, but really we just use that as an excuse to meet people, make friends, and hopefully add a little more brightness to the day. We’re about lifting people up and spreading cheer - if we haven’t done that by the time you’ve left our window… we’ve failed.</p>

            <p>Example of Reviews: </p>
            <p>Four Stars - This place is really great! They have some really good drinks. I'd recommend getting the My Little Pony. It's a sweet drink that taste like fruit. The hot chocolate is also pretty good. I definitely recommend this place just because they are able to make some mixed drinks. The only suggestion I have is maybe make those drinks a little more available so that way any new people coming in will know what to go for.</p>

            <p>Five Stars - When I get Pick Me Up, I always order a custom drink and they make it perfect every time. They’re always super friendly, and that’s not exclusive to the Rexburg locations. Each one I go to has been great</p>
